Changes with lua-resty-session 1.1                                3 Oct 2014

    *) Security: There was a bug where additional user agent, scheme, and
       remote addr (disabled by default) was not checked.

    *) Feature: Added _VERSION field.

    *) Change: Simplied a code a lot (e.g. internal setcookie and getcookie
       functions are now cleaner). Removed a lot of unneccessary lines from
       session.start by adding configs directly to session prototype.
